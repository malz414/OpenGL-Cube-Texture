# OpenGL-Cube-Texture

This texture mapping and rendering program utilizes advanced rendering techniques such as blurring, bloom, normal mapping, and parallax mapping to enhance the visual quality of 3D objects. It also supports different lighting effects and provides users with tools to texture and manipulate objects in real-time.

Features

    Yexture texture mapping and rendering
    Blurring and bloom effects for enhanced visuals
    Normal mapping for realistic surface details
    Parallax mapping for depth perception
    Different lighting options for varied effects
    Object manipulation tools for texturing and modeling

Requirements

    OpenGL compatible graphics card
    OpenGL libraries
    C++ compiler (if building from source)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/malz414/OpenGL-Cube-Texture.git
